            <h2> New version of hill climb 2</h2> 
            <p>The Tank is a good heavyweight vehicle, which makes it useful for destroying breakable objects. When combined with heavyweight parts that are well upgraded, it is capable of instantly plowing through destructible obstacles. </p>
            <p> Although the Tank is not particularly fast, but very fast for a typical "Reality Tank," it is quite stable and the tracks gives it good grip, especially around uneven terrain. Its fuel tank is also big, being useful for Adventure maps.</p>

 <p> If you are in an event or just want to do stunts with Tank, using the Air control and Wings tuning parts may give the Tank better response time, as it cannot lean forward or backward very fast or fly far, being essential to correct mistakes mid-air and land properly. Rollcage can be useful too, especially in Mines and Patchwork Plant, as the character sits at the top of the tank turret, being susceptible to hit a ceiling. The cannon can stop the Tank crashing into a wall head-on, but it may get broken. In Adventure mode, breaking the cannon off can make the tank more stable. Tank can get big records in Adventure when the cannon is broke, and also because Tank is great at climbing hills, and better with Wheelie Boost. Overcharged turbo and Coin Boost are also good parts on Tank, but since the vehicle has tracks and it's heavy, the Jump Shocks are weak, making Kangaroo bad on Tank. </p>

 <p> Earlier in the game, Tank suffered a glitch where after detaching the cannon and terribly hard frontal landing would cause players to get stuck inside. This glitch was patched in December 2019 update and most records on Adventure maps that use this glitch (Mainly on Rustbucket Reef) are being replaced.</p>

 <p> And again in 2021, some players found another glitch that caused the head to get stuck inside the Tank, by slamming into something like the edges of the tubes in Rustbucket Reef to get it stuck, but it wasn't a permanent thing, as hard landings could push the head back out. This glitch was also patched in the 1.47.1 update, with the Scooter Glitch.</p> 

 <p> This is the only vehicle that has the same description as the Tank in Hill Climb Racing 1 </p>
